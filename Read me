Instructions for running server
	Go to the folder where the server is located and write the following:
	npm install
	npm start

Design decisions
	A unique item id was created by choosing a random number and comparing it against an array of all current restaurant IDs. Once all the numbers in that range have been used for IDs, the range is doubled, to allow more possible IDs.
